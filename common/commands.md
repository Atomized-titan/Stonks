#### Welcome to the official commands list! Here you can find all available commands and details on how to use them. <br>

### NOTE: If you didn't see an introduction message when the bot joined or the bot does not respond to you, it is missing permissions! 

To resolve permissions issues, kick the bot and add it back using [THIS INVITE LINK](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=844842149006802944&permissions=4161141840&redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A5000&scope=bot) and keep the requested permissions checked! These permissions are **REQUIRED** for the bot to work correctly!! If you need help, join the support server using the link at the bottom of this page.

#### All commands follow this general structure unless noted otherwise: `.s <command> <parameters>`

<br>

## Simple WazirX Price Checks:
##### Usage: `.s p/price <coin><currency>` (Currency: INR or USDT)
This is the most commonly used command in the bot. It's a super simple and fast way to check prices of coins using WazirX. The prices available for this command are updated every 2 minutes and supports all (over 6000 and counting) coins listed on WazirX. You can call the price for just one coin. You must provide the coin TICKER symbol when using this command. For example, Ethereum has the ticker symbol ETH, and Bitcoin has the ticker symbol BTC, and so on..<br>

Examples:
+ `.s p ethinr` : Price of Ethereum in INR
+ `.s price btcusdt` : Price of Bitcoin in USDT<br>
Simple enough right?

#### Multi coin input support coming soon

## CoinGecko coin Description:
#### Usage: `.s info/i <coin>` (any coin)
This is the command to get all the history, description/info, purpose of a specific coin with its symbol.
In this case you must provide the full name of the coin you are searching for. For example, Ethereum has the ticker name ethereum, and Bitcoin has the ticker name bitcoin, and so on..<br>

Examples:
+ `.s i ethereum` : Price of Ethereum in INR
+ `.s info bitcoin` : Price of Bitcoin in USDT<br>

Super cool!

## Market cap of a specific coin:
#### Usage: `.s mc <coin>` (any coin)
This provides the Market cap, supply, and volume data for the provided coin.
In this case you can provide the full name, ticker symbol or the rank of the coin you are searching for. For example, Ethereum has the ticker name ethereum, and Bitcoin has the ticker symbol btc, a rank, and so on..<br>

Examples:
+ `.s mc ethereum` : Market Cap of Ethereum in USDT
+ `.s mc xrp` : Market Cap of XRP in USDT<br>
+ `.s mc 5` : Market Cap of the 5th ranking coin in USDT<br>

Now you have a lot of data on a single coin!
